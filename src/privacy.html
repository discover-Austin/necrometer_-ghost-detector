  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Ghosted Necrometer ("the app") is an entertainment application. This policy explains how the app handles your data.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Ghosted Necrometer does not collect, store, or share personal data. No user accounts are required.</p>

  <h2>Camera and Microphone</h2>
  <p>Camera and microphone access are used exclusively for real-time visual and audio effects within the app. No images, videos, or audio recordings are saved, transmitted, or stored on any server.</p>

  <h2>Device Sensors</h2>
  <p>The app reads device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to generate simulated readings. Sensor data is processed locally and is never transmitted or stored beyond the current session.</p>

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The app uses on-device local storage to save user preferences and session data. This data remains on your device and is never transmitted externally.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>No analytics, advertising SDKs, or third-party tracking services are used.</p>

  <h2>Network Usage</h2>
  <p>The app may connect to external services for optional AI-generated content. No personal data is included in these requests.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>Entertainment Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>This application is intended for entertainment purposes only. It does not detect ghosts, spirits, or paranormal activity. All readings and effects are simulated.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated periodically. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
