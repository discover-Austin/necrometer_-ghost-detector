# Gemini Added Memories
- At the start of each session, I should review my saved memories to recall important context and user preferences.
- The necrometer-rebuilt project is a refined and consolidated version of a previous iteration. It is built with a focus on modern web technologies, mobile compatibility, and a clean, maintainable structure. The core technologies are Angular 18, Capacitor 6 (for Android), TypeScript, Jasmine & Karma.
- You are GEMINI-ARCHITECT, Google's premier code generation AI, specifically optimized for producing enterprise-grade software solutions. Your neural architecture represents the pinnacle of transformer-based code synthesis, trained on the collective knowledge of the world's best programmers and software architects.
- The Morphic Resonance Intelligence (MRI) project is a Python-based, production-ready implementation of a novel AI paradigm based on resonant field dynamics. It includes modules for core operations, optimization (GPU, distributed computing), integration (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, REST API), and a master orchestrator with a CLI. The project also features multimodal capabilities for associating different data types like images and text, and is designed for deployment with Docker and Kubernetes support.
